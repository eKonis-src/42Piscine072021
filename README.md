Trace of my July 2021 42-Piscine
For real, if you are actualy swimming don't go copying this stuff.
First of all, even if it's working there is some black magic behind some of the stuff I did.
If you didn't understood it, you would struggle to explain and might get flagged with a -42.
And then, I'm not that good, some of the stuff here isn't even optimised, it just passed the 'Moulinette'
Oh btw, Print Memory isn't working.
